# CDM_Coursework2

Welcome to our repo for Coursework 2.

Data anonymisation for 2 scenarios:
1. research use: aim to keep individual level data but reduce risk of re-identification of individuals
2. release for public use: aim to keep group level data but avoid pseudonymisation

anonymizer.py takes the data from Data/customer_information.csv, manipulates it, then saves it in the same place.

Researchers.py creates the data set for research use
Researchers_v2.py employes a differnt set of methods for anonymisation, aiming to retain high level of granularity.
